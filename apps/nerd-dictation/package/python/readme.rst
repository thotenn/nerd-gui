Packaging with PIP
##################

To install ``nerd-dictaiton`` as a package from pip:

``cd`` into the root of this GIT repository, then run:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install ./package/python

On a typical Linux system this will install nerd-dictation to ``~/.local/bin``.

Note that some Linux systems disallow this, requiring the installation be performed from a virtual-environment.
